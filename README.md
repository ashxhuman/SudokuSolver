# SudokuSolver
Situation: Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that challenges players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without any repetition. Sudoku puzzles can have varying levels of difficulty and are often solved using logical reasoning and trial-and-error techniques.

Task: Develop an algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles automatically. The algorithm should take as input a partially filled Sudoku grid and output a completed grid that satisfies all the rules of Sudoku.

Actions:

Represent the Sudoku grid as a 2-dimensional array of cells, where each cell can contain a digit from 1 to 9 or be empty.
Implement a function to check if a given digit can be placed in a specific cell without violating the Sudoku rules (i.e., the digit should not appear in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid as any other digit).
Implement a function to find an empty cell in the grid that has the least number of possible digits that can be placed in it. This helps to reduce the search space and speed up the solver.
Implement a recursive backtracking algorithm to fill in the empty cells of the grid, one by one, by trying all possible digits that can be placed in each empty cell until a valid solution is found. If a cell cannot be filled with any valid digit, backtrack to the previous cell and try a different digit until a valid solution is found.
Optimize the solver by using techniques such as constraint propagation, hidden singles, and naked pairs/triples to reduce the number of possibilities and improve the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm.

Results: The algorithm should be able to solve a wide range of Sudoku puzzles of varying levels of difficulty, from easy to hard. The solver should be able to find a solution quickly (within a few seconds) for most puzzles, although some extremely hard puzzles may take longer to solve or require advanced techniques beyond the scope of this project.

Conclusion: Developing a Sudoku solver algorithm requires a combination of logical reasoning, search algorithms, and optimization techniques. By implementing a backtracking algorithm and applying various optimization techniques, we can solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently and accurately. This project can be extended to include additional features such as a user interface, puzzle generator, and solver statistics to enhance the user experience and make the solver more versatile.
